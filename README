vsp-tests
---------

Test suite for the Renesas R-Car VSP1 and VSP2 video processing engines.

--------
Building
--------

The vsp-tests suite requires the following tools to be installed on the host
to generate the test script and test data.

* make
* python

After installing the needed packages, you can build the test suite by running

	make

in the vsp-tests root directory. Then, to install the test suite, run

	make install INSTALL_DIR=/path/to/target/directory

This will copy the test scripts and data to the target directory to be copied
or exported to the host. As test data take more than 200MB of disk space usage
of nfsroot is recommended to run the tests.


--------------------
Runtime Dependencies
--------------------

The tests scripts require the following tools to be installed on the target
system in a directory included in $PATH.

* compare (part of ImageMagick)
* media-ctl (part of v4l-utils, available at git://linuxtv.org/v4l-utils.git)
* raw2rgbpnm (available at git://git.retiisi.org.uk/~sailus/raw2rgbpnm.git)
* yavta (available at git://git.ideasonboard.org/yavta.git)

All but the HGO test can be run with the latest version of these tools. To
test the HGO, the 'metadata' branch of 'yavta' is currently needed.


-----------------
Running the Tests
-----------------

The test scripts are named vsp-unit-test-[0-9]*.sh. They can be run directly
from the test suite root directory.
