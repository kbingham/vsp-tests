vsp-tests
---------

Test suite for the Renesas R-Car VSP1 and VSP2 video processing engines.

You can find the latest version of vsp-tests in the project's git tree at

	git://git.ideasonboard.com/renesas/vsp-tests.git

--------
Building
--------

The vsp-tests suite requires the following tools to be installed on the host
to generate the test scripts, applications and data.

* gcc
* make
* python

After installing the needed packages, you can build the test suite by running

	make

in the vsp-tests root directory. Then, to install the test suite, run

	make install INSTALL_DIR=/path/to/target/directory

This will copy the test scripts and applications to the target directory to be
copied or exported to the host.


--------------------
Runtime Dependencies
--------------------

The tests scripts require the following tools to be installed on the target
system in a directory included in $PATH.

* compare (part of ImageMagick)
* killall (available from the psmisc package)
* media-ctl (part of v4l-utils, available at git://linuxtv.org/v4l-utils.git)
* raw2rgbpnm (available at git://git.retiisi.org.uk/~sailus/raw2rgbpnm.git)
* yavta (available at git://git.ideasonboard.org/yavta.git)

All but the HGO and CLU/LUT tests can be run with the latest version of these
tools. To test the HGO, HGT and CLU/LUT, the 'vsp' branch of 'yavta' is currently
needed.

The following tool is additionally required to run some of the tests. If the
tool is not available the corresponding tests will be skipped.

* stress (available at http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~apw/stress/)


-----------------
Running the Tests
-----------------

The test scripts are named vsp-unit-test-[0-9]*.sh. They can be run directly
from the test suite root directory.

Test options:

- VSP_KEEP_FRAMES: When the VSP_KEEP_FRAMES environment variable is set to 1,
  all frame files will be preserved regardless of the tests results. Otherwise
  frame files for successful tests are removed.
